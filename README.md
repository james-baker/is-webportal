### Public Site Architecture
* index
* who-we-are
* what-we-do
* get-involved
* history
  * thecall
* questions
* resources

### Changes

new pages:
* about (general)
* content: how we grow
* content: metaware culture

rewrites:
* questions -> FAQ refresh update pass
* who-we-are -> lighter refresh, more specifically listicle characteristics
* what we do -> keep existing points, add multi-scope ecosystem, exterior/doing side
* home -> splash, testimonials, get-involved-hook, about-hook, resources-hook

split "resources" into:
* practices (split: internal v external source?)
* media ? (instead, integrate into friends page?)
* friends

2nd layer "sections" of site? about, resources? or maybe those are more like trailheads to sequences.
or maybe nothing: just stuff in the menu, and a "guided tour" trail of page-bottom links
